## Rec. ITU-R S.465-6 (model `ITUS465`)
The Rec. ITU-R S.465-6 does not define the antenna gain for off-the-axis angles less than φ<sub>min</sub>. Therefore, the gain() method returns None for such cases. The maximum antenna gain in the radiation pattern and as well as in the export files is the antenna gain at φ<sub>min</sub> but not the actual maximum antenna gain.
